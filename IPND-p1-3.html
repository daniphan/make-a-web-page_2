          <u>How the Web Works</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <b>web</b> is a collection of <b>HTML documents</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><u>HTML</u></b> stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. 
          HTML glues all types of content together into a webpage. 
          While HTML is the main type of content found in a webpage, you can find many others embedded into it, such as videos, images, etc.
          The web works by having the browser send request through the internet to a server using a protocol called HTTP.
          Servers are the same as our computers, except that they are used to host the many different files that you can access on the internet.

        <u>Tags, and examples of tags</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different markups you can use to modify the text that you see, and you can make these markups using <em>tags</em>.
        There are opening tags and there are closing tags, and within the opening and closing tag is the content that you want to be displayed (unless it is a void tag).
        The sequence involving the opening tag, content, and closing tag, is called an <em>element</em>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't need to remember every single example of tags (because you can google that!) but there are a couple important tag types. 
        You can use tags to bolden, italicize, underline, and otherwise modify the actual words in the text.
        Tags can also be used to link the text to other types of media, such as links to webpages or images.
        Tags can have multiple attributes (more later).
      </p>
      <p>
        An important distinction is the difference between inline and block tags. 
        The best way to think about this is to imagine that block tags create an invisible box around the content inside of the tag, while inline tags do not.

          <u>How Websites Work</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          A website can employ three different languages, all of which perform different purposes.
          HTML controls the structure, CSS controls the style of the text, and Javascript involves the interactive components of the website.
        </p>

          <u>What is HTML?</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML is a language which has specific syntax and rules. The key with HTML are the tags.
          Each element can be seen in a tree-like structure called the DOM, which stands for the Document Object model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything on the web are boxes. Think about <b>everything</b> about webpages as boxes.
          Browsers see a page in HTML as boxes within boxes within boxes.
          Block elements in HTML (such as body or div or p tags) create these boxes. 
          You can have div elements be placed within other div elements, which means you are putting a box within other boxes!
        </p>

      <h1>Part III: ADDING CSS STYLE AND HTML STRUCTURE</h1>
      <div class="big_blurb">
        <p class="subtitle">
          <u>What is CSS?</u>
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
          CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheets. 
          It is code written to control the style of HTML elements. 
          CSS helps you avoid repetition because you can can style elements in HTML using classes and id's, so that you do not have to style HTML elements individually. This is called abstraction.
          CSS also helps you avoid repetition because you only need to write it once and be able to apply it to as many HTML documetns as you want!
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
          The idea of inheritance is key in CSS. Inheritance basically means that CSS styles as they are applied to texts do not have to be a part of every single element (which would be cumbersome) Instead, styles can be "inherited" between related elements.
        </p>

      <div class="big_blurb">
        <p class="subtitle">
          <u>Selectors</u>
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
          Selectors define what elements of the page the style will apply to. You can also select elements by class. This is why "tagging" your tags is important! Use the CSS documentation to learn the appropriate commands to apply different styles â€“ there are too many to actually memorize.
        </p>

          <u>Box Model</u>
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
          HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components: margin, border, padding, and content. The size of the entire element is the sum of the above widths, except for margin (which is transparent).
        </p>
        <p class="blurb">
          Different browsers behave differently and therefore may display the same code differently. 
        </p>
        <p class="blurb"> 
          You can use the <em>flex box layout</em> to lay out a line and distribute space among items in a container (ie a div).
